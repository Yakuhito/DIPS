# Identity and Retrieval on the DIG Network

## Abstract

This document outlines a proposed approach to identity and retrieval in the Distributed Internet Gateway (DIG) network, which is based on the Chia blockchain. It explains the importance of separating identity from retrieval in a distributed mesh network and proposes a URN-based system for resource identification. The document also discusses various methods for resource retrieval, including intra-network synchronization, Web2 gateways, and Web3 native protocol handlers.

## Introduction

For grounding in the topic of identities, refer to this explanation of the differences between [URIs, URLs and URNs](https://auth0.com/blog/url-uri-urn-differences/).

Though all URLs and URNs are URIs, in practice, location (URL) and identity (URI) have become conflated and are used interchangeably. For the purposes of this proposal, URI will be used to refer to non-URN identifiers that contain both identity and retrieval/location in the same construct.

## Why is the difference between identity and retrieval important for DIG?

In practice with Web 2, identity and location are synonymous, and that is largely acceptable. It is common practice for resources that matter to have a canonical location, and the majority of resources don't intend to be permanent or often even long-lived. Retrieval-encoded URIs can be used as long-lived identifiers; a good example being the XML namespace for schemas: `https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema`. It looks like a location, and there's even some reference material at that location, but in an XML document, it identifies the schema for XSD.

In a distributed mesh network, there is, by definition, no canonical location. Furthermore, the identity of a resource is permanent, even past the point where it is no longer present on the network. A resource's identity is expected to remain valid and static beyond the specific mechanisms that might be used to retrieve it (see below) and across multiple iterations of the network and its protocols.

## Permanent Identities on the DIG Network

It is proposed that resources on the DIG network be identified by a [URN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8141). For a given store and resource, this urn should be invariant and permanent.

### URN Format

`urn:dig:chia:{storeID}:{optional roothash}/{optional resource key}`

#### Namespace and Namespace Specific String

- `urn` - scheme identifier denoting a URN (required)
- `dig` - identifier that denotes the DIG namespace (required)
- chain name - for example `chia` (required)
- store id - the DIG store identifier (required). This is a unique identifier for a collection of resources within the DIG network.
- roothash - the roothash of the version of the resource being denoted (optional, the latest version is specified if not present)
- resource key - the key of a specific resource within the store (optional - behavior if not specified is store dependent. For example, for a web application, `index.html` would be assumed) _behavior absent a resource key could also mean something like "give me metadata about the store". Making it store specific is a nod to PWAs, SPAs and NFT collections with an index page. Merits further discussion_

### Examples

- URN denoting the latest version of a store:
`urn:dig:chia:17f89f9af15a046431342694fd2c6df41be8736287e97f6af8327945e59054fb`

- URN denoting an individual resource within the latest version of a store:
`urn:dig:chia:17f89f9af15a046431342694fd2c6df41be8736287e97f6af8327945e59054fb/css/app.css`

- URN denoting a particular version of a store:
`urn:dig:chia:17f89f9af15a046431342694fd2c6df41be8736287e97f6af8327945e59054fb:35cccf5cba6e3ee2dcf237b4b8a47c64e89cf733a95c6f5e9ac7062734c22b81`

- URN denoting an individual resource within a particular version of a store:
`urn:dig:chia:17f89f9af15a046431342694fd2c6df41be8736287e97f6af8327945e59054fb:35cccf5cba6e3ee2dcf237b4b8a47c64e89cf733a95c6f5e9ac7062734c22b81/css/app.css`

## Retrieval of DIG Resources

Once identity has been established, any number of retrieval or resolution mechanisms can be established that are completely decoupled from each other. This, if anything, is the biggest reason to be explicit in keeping identity and retrieval distinct. In a distributed, Web 3 mesh network, there will not only be multiple locations for a resource but multiple ways to retrieve it.

### Intra-Network Synchronization

The DIG network needs to identify stores and individual resources as content is exchanged and synchronized between nodes. While the specific mechanisms are still being developed, the proposed URN-based identification system could potentially streamline this process by providing a consistent, network-wide identification scheme for resources. This could facilitate more efficient content discovery, replication, and synchronization across the distributed network. _I don't know much about how this works and whether it would benefit from this approach_

### Web2 Gateway

For Web2 applications (websites and such) to access DIG resources, there will need to be a way for those applications to identify and retrieve DIG resources. URNs lend themselves well to a resolver design, where there is a service, or in the case of DIG, services that can convert from a DIG URN to a resource stream. This would be similar to how ISBN book identifiers can be resolved via multiple Web2 applications: `http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-952-10-3937-9`.

It is proposed that every DIG instance act as a resolver for any resources on the network, even if that resource is not mirrored on that instance. For example, if a resource is not hosted by the node `dig.kackman.net`, the following Web2 URL would redirect to a node that did host that collection:

`https://dig.kackman.net/urn:chia:ad18c23361decb109c6bd5e49162bec9df79e44d0415e3f53a2e0f3416ea3457`

TBD: Resolution could be implicit, meaning the URL format is the same whether the node hosts the resource or not, and it redirects as appropriate. Or it could be explicit, meaning asking for URN resolution is a defined endpoint on the node. This needs to be thought through.

### Web3 Native Protocol Handler

For native DIG applications that have the opportunity to install a [native protocol handler](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2022/01/20/getting-started-url-protocol-handlers-microsoft-edge/), a retrieval scheme can be defined such that native applications interact with DIG directly via its SDK:

`dig://urn:chia:ad18c23361decb109c6bd5e49162bec9df79e44d0415e3f53a2e0f3416ea3457`

In this case, the URN remains the same, but the retrieval scheme (`dig://`) invokes code that can resolve resources without a Web2 intermediary.

## Benefits of the Proposed Approach

1. Persistence: URNs provide stable, long-term identifiers for resources, independent of their current location or availability.
2. Flexibility: Separating identity from retrieval allows for multiple retrieval methods, enhancing the network's adaptability.
3. Scalability: This approach supports the distributed nature of the DIG network, allowing for efficient resource management across nodes.
4. Compatibility: By providing both Web2 and Web3 retrieval methods, the system ensures broad accessibility while supporting next-generation applications.
